# CTCF Binding and Epigenetic Marker Pairing Analysis

This repository contains scripts and data files for making CTCF pairs from CTCF binding motif and making pairs using various epigenetic markers in _Anopheles stephensi_. 

## Repository Structure

### Data Files
- **Drosophila_CTCF_motif.meme**  
  MEME-format file with CTCF binding motif sequences used to identify CTCF binding sites across the _Anopheles stephensi_ genome.
  
- **fimo.tsv.zip**  
  Zipped output from the FIMO tool (MEME SUITE), listing all significant CTCF motif occurrences and their genomic locations.

- **pairs_CTCF.bedpe**  
  BEDPE file with paired CTCF binding sites in a convergent orientation, used for Loop-score calculations.

#### Epigenetic Marker Peak Files
Each file contains genomic regions where specific histone modifications or other epigenetic markers have significant peaks:
  - **H2AK119Ubiq_merged_peaks.bedgraph_peaks.tsv.bed**  
  - **H3K27ac_merged_peaks.bedgraph_peaks.tsv.bed**  
  - **H3K27me3_merged_peaks.bedgraph_peaks.tsv.bed**  
  - **H3K4me3_merged_peaks.bedgraph_peaks.tsv.bed**  
  - **H3K9me3_merged_peaks.bedgraph_peaks.tsv.bed**

### Scripts
- **making_CTCF_pairs.py**  
  Python script for creating paired CTCF binding sites in a convergent orientation, using FIMO-annotated CTCF motif sites.

- **making_pairs_for_peaks.py**  
  Python script for pairing peak sites of various epigenetic markers to analyze potential interactions.

### Documentation
- **README.md**  
  This file, providing an overview of the repository, usage instructions, and methods.

### CTCF Binding Sites Identification
CTCF binding sites were identified using the FIMO tool from MEME SUITE. Convergent CTCF pairs were generated using `making_CTCF_pairs.py`, while peak pairs for epigenetic markers were created with `making_pairs_for_peaks.py`.

## Usage

1. **Identify CTCF binding sites**  
   Use `fimo.tsv.zip` generated by FIMO using `Drosophila_CTCF_motif.meme` as input to define CTCF motif occurrences.

2. **Generate Paired Sites**  
   - Run `making_CTCF_pairs.py` to create paired, convergent CTCF binding sites.
   - Use `making_pairs_for_peaks.py` to pair epigenetic marker peak sites for analysis.

3. **Calculate Scores**  
   With paired data, apply `coolpup.py` to calculate the TAD and Loop scores based on the processed Hi-C contact matrices.
